## myBurger - Course Project

Burger App is a course project designed for [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://twitter.com/maxedapps?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). I'm currently working on this project and coding along with Max, and this repository was created to sharpen my knowledge of JavaScript, React, Git and GitHub.
